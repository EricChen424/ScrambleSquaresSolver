# ScrambleSquaresSolver
Interactive solver for the 3x3 puzzle, Scramble Squares

Overview
----------------
Scramble Squares is a puzzle involving 9 squares with a half-image on each side of one of four images, arbitrarily labeled "Aa", "Bb", "Cc", and "Dd". To solve a Scramble Squares puzzle, the 9 squares must be arranged as a 3x3 square in which all 24 sides lying on the inside of the 3x3 square have their half-images joining to make correct, complete images (eg. "AD" or "aB" are not correct, although complete, images, whereas "Aa" or "aA" are). The 12 sides forming the perimeter of the 3x3 square can have any half-image.

To use this app, it's preferable to first number your squares from 1-9 to keep track of them. Next, define each unique half-image as one of the remaining letters a-d, and that half-image's counterpart as the capital letter equivalent. Click "Add Square" and input each square, then click "Solve Puzzle" to produce the solution.
